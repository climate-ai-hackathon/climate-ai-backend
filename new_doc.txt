PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Mangrove Restoration Initiative

1. PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project

The proposed project focuses on the restoration of 2146.48 hectares of degraded lands in Magyi, Thabawkan, and Thaegone village tracts in the Northern part of Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar. The objective is to establish and maintain a sustainably managed mangrove ecosystem for carbon sequestration, natural disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction with sustainable livelihoods in coastal communities, and conservation of biodiversity, including the establishment of the first mangrove gene bank in Myanmar.

1.2 Project Location

The project is located in the Northern part of Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar, covering 2146.48 hectares of degraded lands in Magyi, Thabawkan, and Thaegone village tracts.

1.3 Mangrove Species and Planting

A total of 9,116,390 mangrove plants will be planted, using species such as Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera sexangula, and Ceriops tagal. These species were selected based on their suitability for the local soil and environmental conditions, their contribution to carbon sequestration, and their potential benefits for local ecosystems and livelihoods. Additional species may be considered in the future based on research findings and community needs.

1.4 Project Implementation and Community Engagement

The project will engage local communities through community meetings, consultations, and participation in project planning and implementation. We will also promote a working family model where both men and women can actively participate in the project and provide support for women-led projects and scholarships for girls from poor families.

1.5 Project Start Date and Crediting Period

The project started on June 1, 2020, and has a crediting period of 20 years, from June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2040.

1.6 Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals

The project is estimated to sequestrate 3.68 million tCO2e over a period of 20 years.
